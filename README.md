# Ice Simulator

For now just generates Perlin noise, and displays in 3d as surface normal or B&W based on height.

Set up using CMake, which Visual Studio should recognize.

## Example Outputs

<img alt="Detail heightmap generated with the tool" src="./img/height.png" width="576">

<img alt="Corresponding normal map" src="./img/normal.png" width="576">
