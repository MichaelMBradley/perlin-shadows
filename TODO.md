# Real-time Shadow Simulator

Project submitted for school assignment in current state, but there are still things that could be better.

## Bugs

* [ ] Seams between tiles
* [ ] Are normals a bit off?
* [ ] Perlin noise generation somewhat broken when grid width != length

## Improvements

* [ ] Multiple light sources
* [ ] Dynamically swap cell triangle order to better fit flat surface (<ins>|/|</ins> vs <ins>|\\|</ins>)
* [ ] Adjust shadow detection bias (based on normal?) to smooth shadow gradient a bit
    * [ ] Make shadows softer at long distances?
